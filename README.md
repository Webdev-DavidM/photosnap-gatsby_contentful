# Photosnap website

## Overview

This project is a simple 4 page website. I have created it to practice using
gatsby, contentful, graphQl and Sass with BEM methodology. The key features I
have used for gatsby are

- Static pages.
- Using graphql to query contentful and display the data.
- Using gatsby image plug in to create responsive images.
- Creating story pages dynamically using Gatsby createPage method.
- Using Gatsby's layout component to add the header and footer to each page.

## Features

- The user can navigate to each page via the header and footer.
- There are several animations including a moving arrow and gradient.
- On the pricing page the user can select each plan and also the cost monthly
  and annually.
- Full responsive, on mobile the menu become a drop down menu with a modal.

### Still to do

# To run locally

In order to run this project locally you would need to create your own
contentful account, content model and content with them. You can then add your
own content token and space id to connect the application. See the contentful
and gatsby docs for more information.
